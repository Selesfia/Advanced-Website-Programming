Using data from homework as the base and 50% with the help of ChatGPT to complete the MidTerm project. 
And all the homework i do it by first understanding laoshi video at Youtube and the reference that laoshi give to finish the homework, and if i still don't understand it i look at some reference and ask ChatGpt.

PS: Really sorry laoshi that i can't directly go to class to explain my homework as i already 
go back to my home country because i already bought the tickets long ago.
